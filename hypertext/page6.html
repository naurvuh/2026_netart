<h1>"Yves!"</h1>
<br>
<h2>"Was that Yves?"</h2>
<br><h4>You hear from Katseye's dressing room.</h4>
<br>
  <p>You walk down the hall to the left. After scowering each door for her name, you do not find it.</p>
<br>
  <p><h2>Attention, Attention.</h2></p>
<br>
  <p><h2>"Please be seated, the show is about to start!"</h2></p>
<br>
  <p><strong>You do not congratulate PinkPanthress.</strong></p>
<p>You try to look away during Katseye's performance, out of embarassment for ignoring them.</p>
