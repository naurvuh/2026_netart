<h1>You figure your publicist probably knows what's best for you.</h1>
<br>
<br>
<h2>"Was that Yves?"</h2><h4>You hear coming from the dressing room.</h4>
<br>
<br>
<h4>You respond, "I sincerely apologize for that. I would like to finish the interview, if you will allow me.</p></h4>
<br>
<p>The interviewers accept your apology, and you run through your typical avoidant media-trained responses. <strong>You watch her move to the dressing room.</strong></p>
<br>
<br>
<p><h2>Attention, Attention.</h2></p>
<p><h2>"Please be seated, the show is about to start!"</h2></p>
<br>
<br>
<p><strong>You do not congratulate PinkPanthress.</strong></p>
<p>You try to look away during Katseye's performance, out of embarassment for ignoring them.</p>
