    <h1><em>I'll Change for You</em></h1>
    <b>Mitski</b>
    <hr>
    How do I let our love die<br>When you're the only other keeper<br>
    Of my most precious memories?<br>
    Yeah, I've been drinking<br>
    <br> Why's that gotta mean<br>
    I can't call you 'bout you and me?<br>
    
    <ol><li>[Chorus]</li>
        <li>'Cause I'll do anything</li>
        <li> For you to love me again</li>
        <li> If you don't like me now</li>
        <li> I will change for you</li></ol>
    
    <ul> [Verse 2]
        <li>Bars, such magic places</li>
            <li>You can be with other people</li>
                <li>Without having anyone at all, but now</li>
                    <li>They say they're closing</li>
                        <li>So I'm loitering outside</li>
                            <li>Watching all the cars passing by</li>
                                <li>Like a kid waiting for my ride</li></ul>
    
    &nbsp;[Chorus]&nbsp;
    <p> I'll do anything</p>
    For you to love me again</p>
    If you don't like me now</p>
    I will change for you</p>
    I'll change for you</p>
