    <div><p>nova, 2026.</p></div>

</body>
<p>In 2026, I will have unwavering faith in myself</p>
<p>I am more than ready to step into who I want to be</p>
<p>To a healthier lifestyle</p>
<p>Paying no time to things that don't fulfill me</p>
<p>It is my responsibility and duty to myself</p>
<p>to protect my energy and time as something sacred</p>
<p>To create, to love, to let go</p>
<p>But to also face challenges with strength</p>
<p>resiliance</p>
<p>and grace.</p>
<div class="endoftext">
<p>Thank you, 2026</p>
<p>This is a love letter, an ode to you</p>
<p>a promise</p>
<p>I will not let you down</p></div>

<div class="bottomright">
<p>also,</p>
<p>This serves as protection from thoughts that try to drag me away</p>
<p>and tear me apart</p>
<p><span>this s*** has been going on too damn long</p></span>
<p><span>i will love myself despite my fears and anxiety</p></span>
<h1 id="myHeader"><span>and nothing can stop me</span></h1>
